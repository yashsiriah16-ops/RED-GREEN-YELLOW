# RED-GREEN-YELLOW
Designed a traffic light controller using the Mealy FSM model in Verilog. Outputs depend on both state and input, enabling faster transitions. Simulated transitions between Red, Green, and Yellow states. Gained insights into input-driven state logic and efficient FSM implementation using Vivado simulation and waveform analysis.
